Description: Tools for spectral analysis (including higher-order statistics), filtering, interpolation and resampling, and visualization.  Many of the tools included in the package exist elsewhere in the R universe, but have inconsistent definitions and inputs/outputs that mesh poorly.  New tools include fast hadamard and walsh transforms, multi taper bispectral estimation and Lanczos filters.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
